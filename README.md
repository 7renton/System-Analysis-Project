# System-Analysis-Project

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a learning management system, specifically tailored to drivers’ education. It would have a course, tests, and the ability to book in-person driving lessons.

•	What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well, I believe, was my UML sequence diagram. I thought it was easily readable and would depict the proper functions of that part of the system accurately.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part to revise, I think it would be the functional and nonfunction requirements section. It still feels like the differences between the two are a little vague.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user needs and implemented them because I continuously referred to the initial meeting that was had with them and made sure what I was doing was lining up with what they were saying.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
If I had to say how I approach design software I would say, outside-in. I would start on the outside, with what the software is supposed to be and what it’s supposed to do. Then I would focus on the inside and figure out how that can, and if it can, be implemented.
